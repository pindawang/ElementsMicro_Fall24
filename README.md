# Elements of Micro TA Section 03
This repository stores all materials for TA section 03 of the course 180.102 Elements of Microeconomics in Fall 2024 at Johns Hopkins University. Slides are posted under the "Slides" folder after each session. I will also post additional pratice problems under the "SupplementalProblems" folder. These supplemental problems are completely optional; they come with solutions attached anyway.

Any questions? Email [pwang66@jhu.edu](mailto:pwang66@jhu.edu).
